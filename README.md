# Honeycomb

What is Honeycomb?
    Honeycomb is a 2D puzzle game based on a hexagonal grid. The goal of the game is to touch all flowers in the level and make it back to the hive.

To download a playable version, go to "https://download-directory.github.io/" and copy and paste this link into the URL text box: "https://github.com/jadeandtea/Honeycomb/tree/main/Honeycomb/Builds". The website will automatically download a zip file that contains all builds of the game. For Windows, the only runnable versions are in folder that contain a .exe file. For MacOS, the files that show up as applications are runnable.


To open the project in Unity, you will need to first install Unity. You can download it here: https://unity.com/download. Just scroll down a little if you are not on Mac. If you only care about opening my project, ignore the version download for now. 

First, download the entire project folder by clicking on the green Code button on the front page of the github repository and select your method of download. If you don't know which one to do, download the zip file and extract it after the download is complete. 

Next, open Unity Hub, click on the dropdown menu next to the open button, and select add project from disk. Open the folder you downloaded and unzipped. The project should appear under the listing of project with the name "Honeycomb". There will be an error message that states that the version of Unity is not downloaded. Click on the caution triangle and download the suggested version of Unity. (You should be able to download the most recent version of Unity and the project should fix itself on its first time opening)

Click on the project entry to open the project!
